% Curriculum Advance Algorithms and Data Structures
# Cause Material
* CLRS: "Introduction to Algorithms", third edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
* CGAA: "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications", third edition. The Ch can be found under "Course Material -> Delaunay triangulation reading material"

# Curriculum
* Max flow
    - CLRS Sections 26.1-3
* Randomized algorithms 
    - Motwani & Raghavan Ch 1, beginning plus sections 1.1-2. 
    - Refer to CLRS, Appendix C.3 and C.4 (geometric distribution) for background.
* Hashing
    - "High Speed Hashing for Integers and Strings (revised)" by Thorup. Sections 1-3.3, The proofs for the multiply-shift schemes in 2.3 and 3.3 are not examined.  
    - Also see MR Section 3.2 for Markov and Chebyshev's Inequalities.
* Fibonacci heaps, 
    - CLRS Ch 19. You should be familiar with the potential method, described in Section 17.3, page 459 and the first half of page 460.
* NP-completeness, 
    - CLRS 34-34.3, 34.4-34.5 (except the proof of Theorem 34.13).
* Exact exponential algorithms
    - Fomin & Kratsch, Ch 1 (covered traveling salesman and maximum independent set), plus
* Fixed-parameter tractable problems
    - Selected notes from Rolf Niedermeier,  Invitation to Fixed-Parameter Algorithms (covered vertex cover).
* Approximation algorithms
    - Ch 35 (first half: 35.1,2,3) + (second half)
* Computational geometry (PW)
    - CGAA Ch 9 (except 9.4 and 9.5)
* Linear programming and optimization
