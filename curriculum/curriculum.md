% Curriculum Advance Algorithms and Data Structures

# Curriculum
*CLRS: "Introduction to Algorithms", third edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.*

## Max flow
* *CLRS Sections 26.1-3*

## Randomized algorithms 
* *Motwani & Raghavan Ch 1, beginning plus sections 1.1-2.*
* *Refer to CLRS, Appendix C.3 and C.4 (geometric distribution) for background.*

## Hashing
* *"High Speed Hashing for Integers and Strings (revised)" by Thorup. Sections 1-3.3, The proofs for the multiply-shift schemes in 2.3 and 3.3 are not examined.*
* *Also see MR Section 3.2 for Markov and Chebyshev's Inequalities.*

## Fibonacci heaps, 
* *CLRS Ch 19. You should be familiar with the potential method, described in Section 17.3, page 459 and the first half of page 460.*

## NP-completeness, 
* *CLRS 34-34.3, 34.4-34.5 (except the proof of Theorem 34.13).*

## Exact exponential algorithms
* *Fomin & Kratsch, Ch 1 (covered traveling salesman and maximum independent set), plus*

## Fixed-parameter tractable problems
* *Selected notes from Rolf Niedermeier,  Invitation to Fixed-Parameter Algorithms (covered vertex cover).*

## Approximation algorithms
* *Ch 35 (first half: 35.1,2,3) + (second half)*

## Computational geometry
* *Ch 9 (except 9.4 and 9.5) in "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications", third edition. The Ch can be found under "Course Material -> Delaunay triangulation reading material"*
